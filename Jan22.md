# Theories and History

Some mistake we made aong the history
    - discover all the facts relatd to perception
        - unscalable
        - perception is more than listing facts

Theory
    two way to derive the theory
        intropection - why do the things look the way they do?
            - nativism vs empiricism
                + how much you should pre code?
                + how much prior?
            - atomism vs holism
                + context
            - organism vs environment
                - we are the way we are
                - the word is the way
        behaviour
            robotics??
