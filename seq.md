# Sequence

## Intro
- memoryless models
- maintain hidden states. Only tractable for 2 types of assumption
    + linear dynamical system (gaussian models)
    + HMM have discrete one-of-N hidden state. stochastic
        * have eifficient alg for inference and training
    + RNN
        * Theroretically equivalent to Turing Machine

## Open Problems
- applying RNN to a new problem
- pretraining and transfer
