# conclusion

## what is the right problem?
- extremely difficult problem
    + last few topics: reasoning, VQA, 
- right output?
- right input?
- right data?
    + sometimes it is because the data is bias....
- constant vigilance????

## paper
- read the thoughts / idea of a paper
- reader: 
    + look-out for missing experiments, 
    + strange assumption, 
    + too-good-to-be-true results, 
    + magic algorithms
- critical 

## do not trust algorithms
- in recognition
    + most of the algorithms are far from human performance
        * what we solve is just dataset but not the problem itself
    + black box algorithms...
- 80s: neural net
- 90s: bayesian stuff
- 00s: graphical model

## do not trust data
- __BIAS!!!__
    + TRY SIMPLE THINS FIRST
    + always try lots of baselines to see what the hidden biases are...
    + cross dataset validation(try >=2 dataset)

## don't trust your results...
- too good to be true........
- checking

## positie side...:P
- every paper has a good idea
    + well hidden
    + unintentional 
- negative results is perfect chance to learn something
- be opportnunistic
- trust
    + intuition: / luck: is the most important skills you need to learn
    + don't get stuck  =in a routine
    + positive side of failure
