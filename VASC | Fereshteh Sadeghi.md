# Acquiring and Transferring Generalizable vision-based Robot Skills
`Fereshteh Sadeghi` `UW`

## Motivation
- ICRA 2008, Keenan Wyrobek
    + all sort of home tasks.
- CMU 2016 
    + get cookie and coke
    + precise point cloud, map
- Precise state representation and scriptd policy
    + generalize ?
    + scale ?
- Berkckely, 16 Levine
    + isolated individual task?
    + learnng a repertoire of motion


## History
- vision side
    + data
    + gpu
- robot
    + diverse robot data????
    + challenges:
        * RL: dangers of tiral and error :(, huge data :(
        * demonstration: human, limited diversity
        * perceptive reasoning: semantically rich :)

## learning from Sim
- transfer
- CAD^2 RL
    + very diverse..
    + ok... what's the magic?
    + QA1: data quality of real and simulation. 
    + QA2: how much they could expand? 

## viewpoint invariant
- manipulation with / without same camera point
- view point invariant goal reaching???
- __analogical reasoning__
    + transformation space
    + grey bear->white bear ~ grey dog -> white dog
    + Online self-adaptive control by temporal analogy

## collision avoidance
- coupling colltion avoidance with semantic goal 

## Future
- unstructured environment? 
    + we need to deal with unstructured environment, but .. making the data unstructured is a good way?
- Cheap robot
- !! _VisKE_: visual knowledge extraction
    + life long verification of relation phrases
- Life-long robotic learning
