# Theories and History
`Jan22`
Some mistake we made aong the history
    - discover all the facts relatd to perception
        - unscalable
        - perception is more than listing facts

Theory
    two way to derive the theory
        intropection - why do the things look the way they do?
            - nativism vs empiricism
                + how much you should pre code?
                + how much prior?
            - atomism vs holism
                + context
            - organism vs environment
                - we are the way we are
                - the word is the way
        behaviour
            robotics??

## 4 theory
- structuralism
- getalism
    - partially reject structuralism
    - trying to see the objecdt AS A WHOLE
        - how to group? 
- ecological optics
    + completely reject structuralism
    + focus on the environment rather than the brain
        * crucial to build the outside world
- constructivism
    + prior + what u see
    + 折中的

## David Marr - some turning point
* 4 stages of visual perception
    1. image-based, retinal based, edge, 2d, not exact
    2. surface-based, normal estimation, depends on viewpoint, 2.5d **?? is there fully possiible??? some info lost in edge detection**
    3. object-based, grouping parsing, viewpoint free, 3d
    `is it a bottom-up or top down?` 
    4. category-based representation
    `why people do category: it can relate the image to other meta info. because category follow some patterns in the world`
    `what kind of category is implict and can be different`

## curent pipeline (1990-2010)
1. Images - > 
2. low level -> 
    - SIFT, HOG, edge, blah 
3. midlevel (im)-> 
    - grouping
4. high level
    - sementation using the representation
- problem
    + the boundary between each stage blurrs
        * normally low-level -> directly goes to the high level stages
    + bottom-up? top-down?


## modern (2010 - )
- The boundary / info flow does not matter
- *end to end*, squeeze all middle stages
    + do not need to specify between 
info flows in feedforward (bottom up)
    `but not the same feedback as human > some problem`
    `top-down -> context drivens`
