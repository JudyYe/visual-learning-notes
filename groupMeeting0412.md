## Large scale detection - xiaolong 
## affordance - 
## self-sup from 3D
- find common 3D intermediate representation. 

## semantic, / visual embedding

## incremental learning - ishan
- xiaolong: 2D representation is solved... in some sense
- if we can do solve 0  / few shot, online learning will be sovled 
- if we can learn generic representation, then don't need to online leanring
