# Computational Sensorimotor Learning
`[website](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pulkitag/)` `Feb 27th` `VASC`

## Motivation
- problem
    + lots of data
    + researd
    + specialist for the task
    + robot: Agent's observation -> goal
        * reinforcement learning
        * classical model based control
            - vision to predict physics parameter
            - vision to predict texture 
            - predict nave pysics
        * human infant learning
            - exploration policy
        * How to learn a succesful representation to predict what i want....
