## what is ML and DL?
- Motivation: Curve fitting. "law" 
- Training data in ML
- No simple Law like temporature in vision
- Deep net
    + Knobs, but each depends on other knobs.

- Two Problems
    + solve the dependence? Gradient Descent
        * Why  Gradient Descent work well
    + Why no Overfitting  ?
        * simple laws should have worked better. BUT
        * Deep Nets with more params outperform smaller models

- Designed vs Learnt Systems
- Why theory of DL is nontrivial
    + nonconvex
    + no mathematical characterization (mathematcial structural)

- Working method
    + mask away others while understand one or two methods
    + Playground: Teacher / Student nets and a folklore experiments
    + Playground: trajectory Analysis
    + Unsupervised & generalization problem
        

## Wehere can theory help
- Formulize types of learning that clearly happen but have been hard to capture
- help fundamental understanding in this field

## Example of work
