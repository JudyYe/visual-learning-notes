# Imaging the world one photon at a time
`Matt O'Toole`
## computational imaging
- Computational Cameras
- Computational Displays
Anyalyze the environment: send illumination and collect them coming back 
- Capturing light: 
    + RGB sensor rule: capture intensity
    + SPAD (Single -photon avalanche diode) capture single photon: trigger event, and measure time 
        * how long it travels
        * Batch of photons, Histogram of arrival times

## Application
- transient imaging
    + capture the physical propogation of light 
        * but it took too long to set up (one day / one min / sensitive to vibration / low temporal resolution)
- single-photon 3D imaging
    + Similar for LiDAR
    + Higher resolution & faster speed
    + Reconstruction: Deal with noise from environment.
    + ?? outdoor? scale???
    + Input: 2D array of probability?
- Non-line-of-sight imaging
    + two min scan + 1 sec reconstruction
    + what if the photo never return? not a plate?? how to capture shape? 



- Student?
- Is there benchmark in the communication?
- Assumption of material? detect material?
