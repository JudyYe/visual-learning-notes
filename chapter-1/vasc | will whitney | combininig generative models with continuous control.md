# combining generative models with continuous control
`will whitney` `NYU` `MIT` `model based RL`

import generaztive models idea to robotis

genrative models and video
learn to model with disentanble factor

## intro
- what is object
- weak supervision: factorization in embedding space
- constratints only small units

## past work
- generative model & weak supervised
    + DC-IGN
- generative model & unsup
    + understanding visual concepts with continuation learning
- scale it up better
    + disentanbleing video with independent prediction
        * capturing where's the uncertainty
    + evaluate of the right representation
        * apply to real task
