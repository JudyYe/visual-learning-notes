- building blocks with ball dynamic
    + get sub goal from instruction book
    + to some point, you reach the 'leave node'.
    + __QA: where does the goal come from__
        * learn the goal and skill simutaneously.
    + vision perception
        * in terms of partial function


## Blocks world
- vision = inverse physics, graphics = forward physics
- at that time, vision ppl work from line edge, not raw pixel.
- MIT: describe 3D blocks with graph.  (symbolic)
    + story of detecting arch: feature don't come to you, you need to query feature. ? NP??

- why is it har d to do block  at that time?
    + camera
    + memoery is costly
        * so have to assume perfect input
    + no way to do __continuous feedback__
    + nothing is happening on mechanics side but the vision side.
    + it's the hardware hack that make it work...
