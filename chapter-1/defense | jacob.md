# jacob defense

## intro
- motivation 
    +  semantic(detection)
    +  spatial 
    +  forcasting -> temporal dimension

- representation learning
    + forcasting -> understand a scene

## method
- motion prediction
    + optical flow
    + trajectory
- sturcture space (where large state pixel preidiction is not tractable)
    + mi-level patches
    + human pose

## related work
- domain -dependent forecasting (Kris, Koppula'13, Hoai'2012...)
- motion prediction (nearest neighbor) (pixel)
    + but there is multiple dimension / possibility, ambiguity
- generazation of video

## method
- problem 1: ambiguiry regression(will output 0) -> classification(clustering )
    + do not care clf accuracy
    + but wish to have discriminative class
- problem 2: evaluaion of ambiguity (it is stochastic)
    + eval underlying probability distribution
    + how often will gt occurs generated by the probability
- problem 3: longer time (trajectory)
    + estimate a continuous prob distribution
    + solution: __variation__ method (VAE)
    + __leanrs stochastic viriables that describe input__
    + what is the encoding?(latent variable interpolation) - by visualization
- problem 4: intermediate contribution
    + more tractable
    + patch space
        * do a exempler svm
        * learning patch transition (HMM)
    + pose space
        * we human can factorize the low-level feature out
        * assumption: moving objects are human  and we want to model them
