### Mid-term
- introduce problem
- how you are going to solve
- no result expected

# understanding video
## goal
- given an input video, obtain an understanding
- put individaul element all together. 
    + object
    + human
    + action
- far far away
- SOA: detecting kick ball-30%

## what is action/ activity
- is action just movement?
    + agent + __goal + intention__ + target state + etc
- SOA: most of SOA, are appearance based
    + no concept of motion
    + avearging result
    + no idea of what the problem is, what action is
    + how to represent time?
- term
    + gesture
        * single body part
    + action
    + interaction
    + group activity
- challenge
    + environment variation(separate background and other meaningful things)
    + actor movement variation - but actually detecting chair is also much variation: so it is not the main issue
    + biggest challenge: data
        * sports-1M
        * ucf-101
        * hollywood 2
